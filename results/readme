Reproducing results of experiments.

Each of these examples runs four architectures: 

1.drmt with ipc=1; 

2.drmt with ipc=2; 

3.fine-grained rmt; 

4.coarse-grained rmt.

Three kinds of experiment are maintained here:

1.switch.p4’s ingress pipeline;

2.switch.p4’s egress pipeline;

3.a combined ingress+egress program that runs on a single shared physical pipeline to improve utilization.

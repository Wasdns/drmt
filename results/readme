<-----README----->

Reproducing results of experiments.

Each of these examples runs four architectures: 

1.drmt with ipc=1; 

2.drmt with ipc=2; 

3.fine-grained rmt; 

4.coarse-grained rmt.

Three kinds of experiment are maintained here:

1.switch.p4’s ingress pipeline;

2.switch.p4’s egress pipeline;

3.a combined ingress+egress program that runs on a single shared physical pipeline to improve utilization.

<-----Results Observation----->

Take switch-combined for example.

***** drmt_ipc_1 *****

1.Input DAG

2.for 7 times:

(1)Scheduling DRMT, Running rnd sieve

(2)Running PRMT + rotator, Running greedy heuristic, Running ILP solver

(3)Running DRMT ILP solver

(4)the results of step 2:

- Best achieved throughput = 1 packet every 21 cycles

- Schedule length (thread count) = 505 cycles

- Critical path length = 243 cycles

3.First scheduling period on one processor

4.Steady state on one processor

5.Match units usage (max = 8 units) on one processor

6.Action fields usage (max = 32 fields) on one processor

7.Match packets (max = 1 match packets) on one processor

8.Action packets (max = 1 action packets) on one processor

***** drmt_ipc_2 *****

Same with "drmt_ipc_1";

because of ipc=2:

7.Match packets (max = 2 match packets) on one processor

8.Action packets (max = 2 action packets) on one processor

***** prmt_coarse *****

1.Input DAG

2.Scheduling PRMT fine, Running greedy heuristic, Running ILP solver

3.Schedule

4.Match units usage (max = 8 units) on one processor

5.Action fields usage (max = 32 fields) on one processor

6.Match packets (max = 1 match packets) on one processor

result: empty dictionary

7.Action packets (max = 1 action packets) on one processor

result: empty dictionary

***** prmt_fine *****

Same with "prmt_coarse".
